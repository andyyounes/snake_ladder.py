Draw a simulation of a snake ladder game with estimation time for the game.
The Snake and Ladder game, also known as Snakes and Ladders, is a popular board game played with dice and a game board with numbered squares. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the final square on the board.

Here's a full description of the Snake and Ladder game:

1. Game Setup:
   - The game is typically played by two or more players.
   - The players take turns to roll a dice and move their tokens on the game board.
   - The game board consists of a grid of squares numbered from 1 to a predetermined maximum number.
   - The final square on the board represents the goal, and the first player to reach or exceed this square wins the game.

2. Gameplay:
   - The players start at the first square on the board.
   - On their turn, a player rolls a dice to determine the number of squares they can move forward.
   - The player moves their token forward by the number rolled on the dice.
   - If a player lands on a square with the base of a ladder, they can climb the ladder and advance to a higher-numbered square.
   - However, if a player lands on a square with the mouth of a snake, they must slide down to a lower-numbered square.
   - The positions of the snakes and ladders are predetermined and marked on the game board.
   - The game continues with players taking turns rolling the dice and moving their tokens until one player reaches or exceeds the final square.

3. Winning the Game:
   - The first player to reach or exceed the final square wins the game.
   - If multiple players reach the final square in the same round, the player who rolled the highest number on the dice wins.
   - Some variations of the game may require the exact number to reach the final square. In such cases, if a player rolls a higher number than required, they must move backward by the excess amount.

The Snake and Ladder game is often played as a recreational activity for children and families. It is a game that involves luck due to the random nature of dice rolls but also incorporates decision-making as players strategize their moves to avoid snakes and aim for ladders to progress quickly.
